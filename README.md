# data-qa-agent

An app that automates data science through a conversational **data agent**: users log in, ask questions in
natural language, and an AI agent turns them into governed SQL over data they're authorized to see — then
answers with the result.

The product is branded **Datapilot** in the UI; the repository and services keep the `data-qa-agent` name.

## Quick start (fully local, no cloud)

Requires Docker. One command boots the whole stack — Postgres+pgvector, the Alembic migration job, the
dlt+dbt pipeline, backend-api, data-agent, frontend:

```bash
make up       # build + start everything (migrate + pipeline run first, then the services start)
```

On startup two one-shot jobs run in order: **`migrate`** (`alembic upgrade head` — schema + RLS + seed) then
**`pipeline`** (dlt ingests the CSVs into `raw`, dbt builds the growth marts). By default the pipeline uses the
small committed **sample** so `make up` is fast; load the full real datasets with `make pipeline-full`.

Then open **http://localhost:5230** and sign in as a test user:

| User   | Role  | Sees |
|--------|-------|------|
| admin  | admin | all data |
| user1  | user  | the `nsw_sales` + `nsw_rent` datasets |
| user2  | user  | **nothing** — demonstrates row-level isolation |

Ask e.g. *"What are the top growth suburbs for sale price and rent?"* — the agent derives growth from the
sales and rent aggregate marts. Sign in as `user2` and ask the same thing: you'll get zero rows, because Row-Level
Security isolates them.

### The data

Two real NSW datasets (place the CSVs in `data/`, they are gitignored — too big to commit):

- `data/nswgov_df.csv` — NSW Government property **sales** (~516 MB) → `marts.property_sales`
- `data/rentboard_df.csv` — NSW Rental Bond Board **rent** (~63 MB) → `marts.property_rent`

Small committed **samples** live in `data/samples/` (regenerate from the full files with `make samples`); they
keep `make up` and CI fast while preserving suburbs present in both datasets across the growth window.

```bash
make smoke    # end-to-end test: login -> ask -> response, query audit, and RLS isolation
uv run pytest -q  # unit tests (guardrails/NL->SQL) + journey evals (skip if stack down)
make logs     # tail service logs
make down     # stop the stack
make reset    # stop AND wipe the db volume (re-seeds + reloads on next `make up`)
```

## Architecture at a glance

Three services + one database, matching the locked design (see `AGENTS.md` for the full picture):

```
   data-pipeline (dlt + dbt)  ──build──►  marts.*
        (raw → staging → marts)               ▲
frontend (React+Vite)  →  backend-api (FastAPI)  →  data-agent (NL→SQL / DeepSeek)
      :5230                     :8000                     :8100
                                   │                         │
                                   └──────► Postgres + pgvector (RLS) ◄──────┘
                                                  :5434
```

- **frontend** — login + chat UI (responsive desktop/mobile layout, system-preference light/dark theme with a
  persisted manual override), fires product-analytics events, includes an admin dashboard.
- **backend-api** — validates the JWT, sets the per-request RLS context, orchestrates the agent, records
  conversations/messages/events.
- **data-pipeline** — dlt ingests the CSVs into `raw`; dbt transforms `raw → staging → marts` (tests + docs),
  building the two suburb-keyed growth marts with RLS applied by post-hooks.
- **data-agent** — turns the question into a single read-only `SELECT` (JOINing the marts on `suburb` for the
  combined view), runs it under RLS, phrases the answer, optionally renders a chart. Offline stub by default;
  DeepSeek (or Claude) when a key is set, grounded in the dbt manifest, personalized by pgvector memory, traced
  with Logfire (Decision G).
- **Postgres** — one DB, schemas `app` / `raw` / `staging` / `marts`; RLS enforces who sees which rows.

### How a question flows

1. Sign in → backend issues a signed JWT (dev-auth stub locally; Microsoft Entra in production).
2. Frontend calls `POST /ask` with the bearer token.
3. Backend sets `app.current_user_id` on the DB session → **RLS scopes every query to that user**.
4. Backend delegates to the data-agent, which runs a governed `SELECT` (read-only role, SELECT-only
   allowlist, single statement, row cap) — still under RLS.
5. The answer + generated SQL + rows stream back to the chat UI.

## Data pipeline (dlt + dbt)

`services/data-pipeline/` is the `pipeline` job. `run.py` runs **dlt** (CSV → `raw.property_sales` / `raw.property_rent`) then
`dbt build` over `services/data-pipeline/dbt/`:

- `staging.property_sales` / `staging.property_rent` clean the raw rows; `int_postcode_geo` keeps the
  suburb↔postcode bridge for rent lookups.
- `marts.property_sales` and `marts.property_rent` are the two aggregate marts, one per staging table. They
  keep cleaned attributes plus additive metrics so the agent can re-aggregate and derive growth/yield later.
- `dbt docs generate` writes the manifest the agent reads (`get_schema()`), grounding the LLM in the real marts.

Run on the sample with `make pipeline`, on the full data with `make pipeline-full`. dbt tests run as part of
`dbt build` — structural (`not_null`, uniqueness in `dbt/tests/assert_*_unique_*.sql`) and use-case sanity
checks (`dbt/tests/assert_*_has_coverage.sql`, `assert_growth_pct_*`, `assert_yield_pct_*`) that assert each
mart actually has enough postcodes and sane values to answer the questions it's meant for — a build fails if a
mart can't support its use case, not just if it's malformed.

**Reviewing raw → staging → marts:** run `make pipeline` (or `-full`) then `make pipeline-docs` to serve the
dbt docs UI at http://localhost:8180 — lineage graph, every model's SQL, and column descriptions (the same
text `get_schema()` feeds the agent) for `raw` sources through `staging`/intermediate to `marts`. To inspect
actual rows/counts at any layer, connect to Postgres directly (`localhost:5434`, schemas `raw`/`staging`/`marts`
— see Ports below).

## Admin Dashboard

Sign in as `admin` and use the **Admin** button to inspect the live events feed, users, datasets, and audited
agent query runs. Each answered question writes a `query_runs` row with the user, dataset, SQL, row count,
latency, and engine.

## Authentication (dev stub → Microsoft Entra External ID)

Auth runs in one of two modes, chosen at runtime — the frontend reads `GET /auth/config` and adapts, so
**flipping to real auth needs no rebuild**:

- **`dev` (default)** — a local dev-auth stub. The login screen shows the three seeded users; the backend
  mints a signed HS256 token. Everything runs offline.
- **`entra`** — real **Microsoft Entra External ID** (OIDC). The frontend signs in via MSAL
  (`@azure/msal-browser`); the backend validates the RS256 token against the tenant's public **JWKS**
  (no client secret needed), then **just-in-time provisions** the user into `app.users` keyed by their Entra
  `oid`, so RLS and the admin role stay driven by our own database. An app role (default value `admin`) in the
  token maps to the admin role.

To switch, set `AUTH_MODE=entra` and the `ENTRA_*` values in `.env` (see `.env.example`), then restart
backend-api. A real Entra External ID tenant + two app registrations (SPA + API) are required for live login;
until then, `dev` mode is the working local experience.

The `/me` endpoint returns the current user's profile in both modes.

## Using the real LLM agent instead of the offline stub

The agent answers **offline by default** via a deterministic NL→SQL stub, so the demo runs with no API key.
To use the real agent, put a provider key in `.env` (see `.env.example`) and rebuild data-agent — `make up`
already installs the data-agent's `llm` extra. The provider sits behind an abstraction (Decision G), selected
by `LLM_PROVIDER`:

- **`deepseek` (default)** — set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
- **`anthropic`** — set `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

With a real provider, the agent also gets a `make_chart` tool (renders a Vega-Lite chart in the chat UI when
useful) and per-user memory: it recalls relevant past preferences (pgvector cosine search over
`app.user_memories`, RLS-scoped — a user's memory is isolated like their data) at the start of every question,
and calls `remember` when you state an explicit preference (e.g. "I only care about units, not houses").

Every agent run is traced with **Logfire** — tool calls, model requests, and (with `capture_all=True`) the raw
HTTP payloads sent to the provider. Set `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` in `.env` to ship traces to Logfire Cloud; leave it
empty to trace locally with no extra configuration.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use** — the dev DB uses host port **5434** (5432/5433 were taken by other local
  containers). If 5230/8000/8100 clash, change the left-hand side of the `ports:` mapping in
  `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Empty marts / no data** — the `pipeline` job builds the marts. Re-run it with `make pipeline` (sample) or
  `make pipeline-full` (real data), or `make reset` then `make up` for a clean slate (wipes the volume so
  migrations + pipeline re-run).
- **Frontend can't reach the API** — CORS allows `http://localhost:5230`; if you change the frontend port,
  update `cors_origins` in `services/backend-api/app/config.py` and rebuild backend-api.

## Deploy to AWS (live)

The app is deployed to AWS (s12) with Terraform under [`infra/terraform/`](./infra/terraform/README.md):
App Runner runs backend-api + data-agent, ECS Fargate one-shot jobs run the same `migrate`/`pipeline`
images as local (the pipeline streams the full CSVs from S3), Aurora Serverless v2 (scale-to-zero) is the
database, and the frontend is a static Vite build in S3 behind CloudFront. Merging to `main` is the
push-button deploy — `.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml` builds/pushes images, applies Terraform, runs
migrations, deploys the frontend, and smoke-tests the live URL (`scripts/cloud_smoke.sh`); auth is GitHub
OIDC, no stored keys. Cheap hardening ships with it: role-level statement timeouts (migration 0018), tiered
per-user daily AI caps (see below), and CloudWatch billing/5xx alarms → SNS email. See
`infra/terraform/README.md` for the runbook. The earlier Azure Bicep scaffold under
[`infra/`](./infra/README.md) stays as a reference and is not deployed.

### Daily AI usage caps

In the cloud, each user gets a daily budget of LLM-backed calls — `/ask`, `/ask/stream`, and the SQL
editor's AI assist share one counter (resets midnight UTC; exceeding it returns **429**): free **5/day**,
paid (plan `plus`/`pro`) **10/day**, admins uncapped. `ASK_DAILY_LIMIT_FREE` / `ASK_DAILY_LIMIT_PAID`
tune the limits (0 = off); the local compose stack sets both to 0 so repeated `make smoke` runs never 429.
